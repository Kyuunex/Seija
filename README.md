6. Before using, you need to create a folder called `data` and create `token.txt` and `osu_api_key.txt` in it. Then put your bot token and osu api key in the files. 
7. Run `run.py` with command line, like `python run.py` on windows or `python3 run.py` on linux or use the batch file or however you want. It's recommended to run it in a loop so it restarts when it exits. Built-in updater requires this.
