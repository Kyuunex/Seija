# Contributing

Getting started on contributing to this project is not rocket science, 
but it may be if you have never written a piece of code beyond 'Hello World' in your life.  
While we are not expecting you to write a professional grade code, whatever that means, 
we do have some quality standards because we don't want to deal with cleaning up someone's mess down the road.  
To get an idea of what quality code we expect from you consider watching 
[this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-njsRb8Tn70). if you understand everything 
that is going on in the video, and you see yourself writing good code like that, you are good to go.

Before working on anything, consider discussing it in the #bot_dev channel over at our 
[Discord Server](https://discord.gg/8BquKaS). 
We have a [Trello Board](https://trello.com/b/D5gqJIjO/seija-discord-bot) that contains things
that are planned to be done. 

# Ok, so how do you get started?
Simply go through the Trello board and see if you can find the relevant parts of the code that need to be changed 
to perform the given task. If you think you have it figured out, send us a pull request,
but before you do, make sure you test what you make.

# Code of Conduct

You must contribute in good faith. 
This means, no 'hypocrite commits', no vandalism, no obscene language and no discrimination.
